# DevOps team
Where the [litterpickers](litterpickers.md) are doing the outside activities, the developers and operatoins voluntiers are working from their computers.
We have enthusiastic developers who help us with building new features or resolving bugs in all code we are using.

#### Helping is possible
If you want to contribute to the project, please reach out to the community coordinators. They can help you with access, a project and support to contribute.

#### Operations
We have a NoOps approach. Most opeations is done by services or jobs we have up and running.
If manual action is needed, the team is doing the job.
