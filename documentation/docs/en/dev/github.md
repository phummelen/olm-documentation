# Version Control

We change our code on a regular basis. To have good code, we use version control on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

We have different repositories where our code resides. For different purposes and different update cadences.

For the use of Git, there are lots of tutorials. For now, it's not written out here.
*Maybe one of the other team members will add his (or her) experiences here*
