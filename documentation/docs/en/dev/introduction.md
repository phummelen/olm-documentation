# Introduction

This software is opensource. That mean you can use, change, fork or whatever other something is convenient.
We still love if you participate in the community, to get better software, better data or spreading the same message all over the world.

To be able to assist the core team in the development, we have tried to have the software easy to use on the local machine.

This section is created to help you start up locally and help the development. If you have any question please reach out to the development team for help.
