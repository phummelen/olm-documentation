# Littercoin

Littercoin is the reward that our users get for producing geographic information. You can not buy Littercoin. You can only earn it by joining the community and helping us collect data.

Littercoin does not yet have a value, but we are working on it by locking ADA in a smart contract which will give each Littercoin value. Our vision is that your Littercoin can only be spent at participating pre-approved zero-waste stores that partner up. Unlike traditional government money that is printed out of thin-air, Littercoin is a new type of environmental currency that is created by people helping to clean the planet and can be spent in climate-approved stores only.

Unlike other cryptocurrencies, we are not going to list Littercoin on any exchange, making it non-tradable. The smart contract will be able to verify the integrity of each token, proving it has not been traded or listed on an exchange.

Cheating the system (‘oh, let me just drop a bunch of litter here and take a lot of photos of it’) is possible, but in reality, nobody does this and the benefits will far outweigh any cheating. There is also so much litter out there that finding it is much easier than carrying it around. We have a system in place that involves reviewing all tags on each image. This is generating high quality data that is being used to train the OpenLitterAI, which will make verification easier. If you really want to cheat the system, you might as well rob a zero-waste store. (Please don’t).
