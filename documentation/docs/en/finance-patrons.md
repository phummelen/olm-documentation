# Patrons
Litterpicking is done outside, managing the backend is done from behind computerscreens. Still, there are persons that would support the project out of bounds.
We do love people that support our project from their own interest.

If you want to be a patrones, reach out to one of the (senior) community members. We normally will ask what contribution someone wants to give. From the community perspective we aim to cover the operational costs. So it's possible to reach out with the proposal to pay for one of the upcoming costs. Will be appriciated!
