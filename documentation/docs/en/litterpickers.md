# Litterpickers

To reach our goals we need data. This data is created by making photo's, tag those and upload.
Our dedicated litterpickers do this real field activity! And we are proud of them. And give them a big thanks for doing so.

You want to become a litterpicker too? Just start the next time you are walking outside and see litter.
That's the main thing. Making the photo is important, for obvious reasons of course.
