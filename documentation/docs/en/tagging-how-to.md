# How to tag ....
We have several **categories** (like smoking, softdrinks, sanitary).<br />
Withing those categories we have different **objects** (like sigarettebutts, waterbottles or facemasks).<br />
<br />
You can also start typing something in the white input-field and see what pops up, for instance type 'bottle' and see what kind of bottle-related tags we have.<br />
If you are really sure you have picked something and we don't have a pre-defined tag for it, you can also type it in the input-field on the right but preferabely use the pre-defined ones because these make up for better quality data.<br />

## The COMB method.
A common, smart way of tagging is based on the C.O.M.B. method.

 - C = Category, like smoking, food, soft drinks
 - O = Object, like (energy-) can, cup, bottle, butt
 - M = Material, like plastic, metal, paper
 - B = Brand, like Heineken, Coca Cola, Mars, Tim Hortons 

In case you do not know what special tag is possible, use the "random litter" tag. But, preferrable, do not using "random" tags .... these are not specific enough!

## Pre-defined Tags versus Custom Tags
There are a lot of pre-defined tags. If possible, use these as much as possible.<br />
If you want an extra tag or add an (still) unknown brand, you can use a custom tag.<br />
<br />
Mostly, custom tags can also be combined / integrated with the C.O.M.B. method.<br />
For example: a bike bell can be tagged as:

 - category:bicycle
 - object:bikebell
 - material:metal
 - brand is unkown, so not mentioned 

<mark>Be aware</mark>: We use the complete text for the custom tag (including category for example).<br />
We use all lower case and no spaces in the custom tag.<br />
<br />
For some special occasions we use a custom tag without the C.O.M.B. value.<br .>
For example we could use WCD2022 for the World Cleanup Day 2022<br />
<br />
Custom Tags can be shown on the global map directly.<br />
