**The mobile app:**

1. the pictures are still on your phone
2. start the openlittermap app, assuming you're registered and logged in already
3. select the round button on the right bottom, with the picture icon in it
4. select the picture from the galery, you have to select them one by one (for now, future will be more easy)<br />
   <mark>be aware</mark> only pictures that are geo-tagged (top right pin) can be uploaded
5. All pictures selected? Click next in the top right
6. Select the first picture, and start tagging
7. you can select via the buttons on top and the rolling list of the category<br />
   or:<br />
   you tag using the search field (my preferable method)
8. all done? swipe down and click on the (big) upload button<br />
   <mark>be aware</mark>, pictures are uploaded in native format, so please think about your data bundle or use a WIFI connection

That's it.<br />
<br />
