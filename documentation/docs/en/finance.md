# Finance

Running an app, a website and the backend server costs money.
We want to be as transparant as possible about the costs.
For several reasons, including the request of sponsoring.

Our main costs are mentioned below, more details are provided afterwards.
- hosting
- access (address and certificate)
- mobile

#### Labour costs
We are a complete voluntairy team working on the project.
Our vision is that we will not pay anybody for contributing to the project. We keep the option open to work with give-aways, prices or bonusses.
We have -at least- two types of team members:

 - [Litterpickers](litterpickers.md)
 - [DevOps members](finance-devops.md)
 - [Patrons](finance-patrons.md)

## Hosting costs
We are running a basic server with all containers on it. Our DevOps team is keen on keeping the costs low. So even good services we could used that costs money are discussed and investigated in-depth.
For now, we are hosting at AWS, where we have a small EC2 machine. For the storage of the photos we are using an AWS S3 bucket.
The costs of AWS are mentioned in the below table.

|2024-01| t.b.m.| Your name here?    |

## Access costs
To be able to access (or connect to) the application we need a web address and a certificate.
We will not have our own mailadresses, maybe in the future we can set it up. Still, if there is a price, we have to think it over.

#### Web address (DNS Record)

## Mobile Apps
We will have the mobile app available on both iOS and Android. This means we have to pay for uploading the app to the both app stores.
The Apple store requires a (yearly) membership account, for the price of $ 99. As of we are a non-profit initiative, we will aim for a free membership.
The Android store requires a one time fee of $ 25.
