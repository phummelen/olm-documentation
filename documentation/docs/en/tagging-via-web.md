**The website on your computer:**

1. Move the pictures from your phone to your computer
2. Go to the website openlittermap.com and login (you need an account)
3. Go to the 'Upload' tab and click to upload photos or drop them there from your photo-folder so they get uploaded
4. When they are uploaded, click on 'Tag Litter'
5. The first picture will be shown.
  If you click on the picture, it will be shown in a bigger view. Press escape to go back to the normal size
6. Define what it is and look for a tag that sounds right.
  Check the "extra info" page for tagging hints.
  If you have found the item, the default number is 1, but you can change that if there are more on the picture.
7. If the object is correct and the number as well, press Add Tag. The tag will show up on the right of your screen.
  If this was not correct, click on that tag, it will disappear again.
8. If there are more objects on the picture that you picked, or if you have extra information about the item, for instance the brand, repeat this process. Start typing the brand and if it does not show up, type the brand in the input-field on the right (but again, if the brand exists as a pre-defined tag, use that one).
9. If you are ready, you can press Submit. The tags are saved and the next picture (if any) will be shown.
