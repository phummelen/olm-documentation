# Main Steps - Common Procedure

### Step One
Take a picture of the litter with your phone. You don't need to open the app for that, just take a picture with your normal phone-camera.
Be aware, we need the GPS location, so get that setting active on your phone.

### Step Two
Depending on what you like best:

 - use the app on your phone to register the data,
 - use the website on your phone to register the data,
 - use the website on your computer to register the data. 


you have to choose if you want to upload the picture via web-app or via the mobile app.
Going the [web way](tagging-via-web.md) …. Upload …. And tag ….
Going the [app way](tagging-via-mobile.md) …. Load the picture, tag them and upload them.

### Step Three
Would you save the pictures?
Once you are ready, you can decide to remove the pictures from your phone and/or computer.

### Conclusion
Then, what to do with the collected data? You can find it on the global map.
If not yet today, for sure it's shown tomorrow!
Hint: click on a digit-round to zoom in.
It's also an option, the pictures are being verified by admins. So if the pictures/tags are not shown on the global map yet, that might mean that your pictures are still under verification.<br />
